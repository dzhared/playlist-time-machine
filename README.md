Make a playlist of the top 100 songs for a given date using Python, BeautifulSoup and Spotipy

# About
This program uses BeautifulSoup4 to scrape the Billboard Top 100 for a given date, then uses Spotify's API via Spotipy to create a playlist for that date.

In order to use this, you'll need to go to Spotify's developer dashboard and generate a Client ID and Client Secret. Once you've entered these and your user ID, you can run the program, enter a date and in ~1 minute have an automatically generated playlist for the Billboard Top 100 on that given date.
